# OpenX
You can create tree by passing root node or by passing values list(If a parent has index n in the list, then it's left child has index 2n+1 and it's right child has index 2n+2)
Class Tree can: 
calculate number of nodes that do not have any children, 
calculate the largest number of edges in a path from the root node to a leaf node 
and check if two instances of above data structures are equivalent to each other.
