# OpenX
You can create tree by passing root node or by passing values list(If a parent has index n in the list, then it's left child has index 2n+1 and it's right child has index 2n+2).<br />
Class Tree can:<br />
a. calculate number of nodes that do not have any children,<br />
b. calculate the largest number of edges in a path from the root node to a leaf node,<br />
c. check if two instances of above data structures are equivalent to each other.<br />
Simple tests are included.<br />
The tests use the testsData.txt file.<br />
Each line in it contains semi-colon separated: <br />
a. comma-separated values of vertices, <br />
b. the number of tree leaves, <br />
c. the largest number of edges in a path from the root node to a leaf node. <br />
There cannot be any empty fields!<br />
Root node value can't be null!<br />
